# Counters and Accumulators Worksheet

## Counter steps
Put each of the following in numerical order starting with the first step and ending with the last:

* Start a for loop for whatever you're repeating
* Update your counter, usually by 1. This is commonly the last thing in your loop.
* Establish you base variable at the initial state (usually 0)
* Do your stuff, whatever you need to do in that loop


## Accumulator steps
Put each of the following in numerical order starting with the first step and ending with the last:

* Determine your value to accumulate
* Start a for loop for whatever you're repeating
* Update your base variable by whatever your incremental value is. This is commonly the last thing in your loop.
* Establish you accumulator base at the initial state (usually 0)
* Do your stuff, whatever you need to do in that loop


## Match the Syntax
Each of the following can be attributed to either a counter, an accumulator, or both. Label them accordingly.

* accum = 0
* accum = []
* accum = ""
* for line in text:
      accum.append(line)
* for element in range(10):
      accum += element
